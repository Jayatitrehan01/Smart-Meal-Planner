# Smart-Meal-Planner
Tired of generic diet apps?

This Smart Meal Planner is your personal AI-powered nutritionist — it understands you, your goals, and your lifestyle, then designs meal plans that actually make sense.

Whether you’re aiming to shed a few kilos, build lean muscle, or simply eat healthier, the app calculates your calorie needs, breaks them into the right balance of protein, carbs, and fats, and then recommends meals that fit your dietary preference (veg, non-veg, vegan).

No more guessing, no more one-size-fits-all diets — just personalised nutrition made simple.

For Example:

* A 22-year-old student, female. 68kg, moderately active, aiming for muscle gain, will get a high-protein, calorie-surplus plan with foods like oats, eggs, paneer, and grilled chicken.
* A 45-year-old office worker, male, overweight, sedentary, aiming for weight loss, will get a low-calorie, balanced plan with soups, salads, and light curries.
  
Every user gets a plan that actually makes sense for them.
